 * "run archive command in this directory under the temp dir" option?
 
 * --paranoid should clear at the _start_ of an archiving module, and should
   be an option at the module level (paranoid=yes or something). Probably
   call it something other than paranoid, too, since this is very misleading.

 * allow temp dir to be altered per-module? Or is this too much hassle?

 * I have a feeling that since mirroring a directory structure isn't much
   hassle, it's easier to do the copy/module steps _always_, but only do
   build steps if they haven't been done before or if we're being paranoid
   about getting the correct build.

 * documentation.
 
 * proper build system, using autoconf et al.
